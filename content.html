    <p>Let me summarize the picture of women’s historical locations in advanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured  partly  through  the  social  relations  of  science  and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women’s  lives  by  the  distinction  of  public  and  private  domains—suggested by images of the division of working-class life  into  factory  and  home,  of  bourgeois  life  into  market  and home,  and  of  gender  existence  into  personal  and  political realms—it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice  and  in  theory.  I  prefer  a  network  ideological  image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. “Networking” is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy—weaving is for oppositional cyborgs.</p>
    <p>So let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination and trace one vision of women’s “place” in the integrated circuit, touching only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Workplace, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work.</p>
    <p>However, there is no “place” for women in these networks, only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women’s cyborg identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life, we might learn new couplings, new coalitions.</p>
    <p>There is no way to read the following list from a standpoint of “identification,” of a unitary self. The issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">Home:</i> Women-headed  households,  serial  monogamy, flight  of  men,  old  women  alone,  technology  of  domestic work,  paid  homework,  reemergence  of  home  sweatshops, home-based businesses and telecommuting, electronic cottage  industry,  urban  homelessness,  migration,  module  architecture,  reinforced  (simulated)  nuclear  family,  intense domestic violence.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"> <i class="italic">Market:</i> Women’s continuing consumption work, newly targeted  to  buy  the  profusion  of  new  production  from  the new technologies (especially as the competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid dangerous mass  unemployment  necessitates  finding  ever  bigger  new markets for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled with advertising targeting of the numerous  affluent  groups  and  neglect  of  the  previous  mass markets; growing importance of informal markets in labor and  commodities  parallel  to  high-tech,  affluent  market structures;  surveillance  systems  through  electronic  funds transfer;  intensified  market  abstraction  (commodification) of experience, resulting in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme mobility (abstraction)  of  marketing/financing  systems;  interpenetration  of sexual  and  labor  markets;  intensified  sexualization  of  abstracted and alienated consumption.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">Paid Workplace:</i> Continued intense sexual and racial division of labor, but considerable growth of membership in privileged  occupational  categories  for  many  white  women and  people of color; impact of new technologies on women’s work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles), agriculture,  electronics;  international  restructuring  of  the working classes; development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy (flex time, part time, over time,  no  time);  homework  and  out  work;  increased  pressures for two-tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people  in  cash-dependent  populations  worldwide  with  no experience or no further hope of stable employment; most labor “marginal” or “feminized.”</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">State:</i> Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with increased surveillance and control; citizenship by  telematics;  imperialism  and  political  power  broadly  in the  form  of  information-rich/information-poor  differentiation; increased high-tech militarization increasingly opposed  by  many  social  groups;  reduction  of  civil  service jobs as a result of the growing capital intensification of office  work,  with  implications  for  occupational  mobility  for women of color; growing privatization of material and ideological life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization,  the  high-tech  forms  of  bourgeois  capitalist personal and public life; invisibility of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms of belief in abstract enemies.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">School:</i> Deepening  coupling  of  high-tech  capital  needs and  public  education  at  all  levels,  differentiated  by  race, class,  and  gender;  managerial  classes  involved  in  educational reform and funding at the cost of remaining progressive  educational  democratic  structures  for  children  and teachers;  education  for  mass  ignorance  and  repression  in technocratic  and  militarized  culture;  growing  anti-science mystery cults in dissenting and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy among white women and people of color; growing industrial direction of education (especially higher education) by science-based multinationals  (particularly  in  electronics-and  biotechnology-dependent  companies);  highly  educated,  numerous  elites  in  a progressively bimodal society.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">Clinic-Hospital:</i> Intensified machine–body relations; renegotiations of public metaphors that channel personal experience  of  the  body,  particularly  in  relation  to  reproduction, immune system functions, and “stress” phenomena; intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical implications of women’s unrealized, potential control of their relation to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles over meanings and means of health in environments  pervaded  by  high-technology  products  and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified  struggle  over  state  responsibility  for  health;  continued ideological role of popular health movements as a major form of American politics.</p>
    <p class="diasporaList"><i class="italic">Church:</i> Electronic fundamentalist “super-saver” preach-ers solemnizing the union of electronic capital and automated fetish  gods;  intensified  importance  of  churches  in  resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women’s meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality, intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle.</p>
    <p>The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist-feminist  politics  addressed  to  science  and  technology  is plain. There is much now being done, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collective struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU’s District 925,<sup>27</sup> should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are  profoundly  tied  to  technical  restructuring  of  labor  processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labor organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues  never  privileged  in  the  largely  white  male  industrial unions.</p>
    <p>The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not  necessary  to  be  ultimately  depressed  by  the  implications of  late-twentieth-century  women’s  relation  to  all  aspects  of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best  and  have  trouble  understanding  what  can  only  look  like false consciousness and people’s complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women’s points of view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face  of  current  violation.  Ambivalence  toward  the  disrupted unities mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of “clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology” versus “manipulated false consciousness,” but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of the game.</p>
    <p>There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of hardship experienced worldwide  in  connection  with  the  social  relations  of  science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack sufficiently subtle connections for collectively building effective theories of experience.</p>
    <p>Present efforts—Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropo-logical—to clarify even “our” experience are rudimentary.</p>
    <p>I am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position—a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik’s impact on U.S. national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post–Second World War arms race and Cold War as by the women’s movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing  on  the  contradictory  effects  of  politics  designed  to produce loyal American technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing on the present defeats.</p>
    <p>The permanent partiality of feminist points of view has consequences for our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction.  Perhaps,  ironically,  we  can  learn  from  our  fusions  with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western  logos.  From  the  point  of  view  of  pleasure  in  these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.</p>

    <p>I want to conclude with a myth about identity and boundaries that  might  inform  late-twentieth-century  political  imaginations. I am indebted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree Jr., Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda Mclntyre.<sup>28</sup> These are our storytellers  exploring  what  it  means  to  be  embodied  in  high-tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring conceptions of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery is to world-view, and so to political language.</p>
    <p>French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism,  cosmology,  and  politics  from  imagery  of  embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.<sup>29</sup> American radical feminists like Susan Griffin, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations—and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.<sup>30</sup></p>
    <p>They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofemi-nism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval’s terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of  late  capitalism.  In  that  sense  they  are  part  of  the  cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly  embracing  the  possibilities  inherent  in  the  breakdown  of clean distinctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of  breakdowns  that  cracks  the  matrices  of  domination  and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political “technological” pollution? I look briefly at two  overlapping  groups  of  texts  for  their  insight  into construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.</p>
    <p>Earlier I suggested that “women of color” might be understood  as  a  cyborg  identity,  a  potent  subjectivity  synthesized from fusions of “outsider” identities, sedimented in the complex  political-historical  layerings  of  Audre  Lorde’s  “biomythography,”  <i class="italic">Zami </i>(Lorde 1982; King 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential. Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her  <i class="italic">Sister Outsider. </i> In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom U.S. workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy  preventing  their  solidarity,  threatening  their  security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider  is  a  potential  amid  the  races  and  ethnic  identities  of women  manipulated  for  division,  competition,  and  exploitation in the same industries. “Women of color” are the preferred labor  force  for  the  science-based  industries,  the  real  women for whom the worldwide sexual market, labor market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy,  especially  in  English,  distinguishes  the  “cheap”  female labor so attractive to the multinationals.</p>
    <p>Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the “oral primitive,” literacy is a special mark of women of color, acquired by U.S. black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and writing. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in “postmodernist” theories attacking the phallogocentrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.<sup>31</sup> Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releas-ing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of U.S. women of color are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before  language,  before  writing,  before  Man.  Cyborg  writing  is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.</p>
    <p>The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that re-verse  and displace  the  hierarchical  dualisms  of  naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfil-ment  in  apocalypse.  The  phallogocentric  origin  stories  most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies—technologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics—that  have  recently  textualized  our  bodies  as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.</p>
    <p>Figuratively  and  literally,  language  politics  pervade  the struggles of women of color; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by U.S. women of color. For example, retellings of the story of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo “bastard” race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherríe Moraga in  <i class="italic">Loving in the War Years </i>(1983) explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate  heterosexuality  in  the  garden  of  culture,  and  so  cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother’s or father’s.<sup>32</sup> Moraga’s writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as  Malinche’s  mastery  of  the  conqueror’s  language—a  violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga’s language is not “whole”; it is self-consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conquerors’ languages. But it  is  this  chimeric  monster,  without  claim  to  an  original  language before violation, that crafts the erotic, competent, potent identities of women of color. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga’s body, affirms it as the body of a woman of color, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of “original illiteracy” of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.</p>
    <p>Writing is preeminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics are the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings that make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of “Western” identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. “We” did not originally  choose  to  be  cyborgs,  but  choice  grounds  a  liberal politics and epistemology that imagine the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of “texts.”</p>
    <p>From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in “our” privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppres-sions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence, and  greater  closeness  to  nature.  With  no  available  original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection  from  hostile  “masculine”  separation,  but  written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize “oneself” as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of identity, the “bastard” race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of color have transformed her from the evil mother of masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.</p>
    <p>This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation.  Every  story  that  begins  with  original  innocence  and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation—that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics—rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes  through  women  and  other  present-tense,  illegitimate cyborgs,  not  of  Woman  born,  who  refuse  the  ideological  resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many times a “Western” commentator remarks on the sad passing  of  another  primitive,  another  organic  group  done  in  by “Western” technology, by writing.<sup>33</sup> These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japanese and U.S. electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and societies.<sup>34</sup> Survival is at stake in this play of readings.</p>
    <p>To  recapitulate,  certain  dualisms  have  been  persistent  in Western  traditions;  they  have  all  been  systemic  to  the  logics and  practices  of  domination  of  women,  people  of  color,  nature,  workers,  animals—in  short,  domination  of  all  constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these  troubling  dualisms  are  self/other,  mind/body,  culture/nature,  male/female,  civilized/primitive,  reality/appearance, whole/part,  agent/resource,  maker/made,  active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.</p>
    <p>High-tech  culture  challenges  these  dualisms  in  intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what is body in machines that resolve into coding practices. Insofar as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs,  hybrids,  mosaics,  chimeras.  Biological  organisms  have become  biotic  systems,  communications  devices  like  others. There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film  <i class="italic">Blade Runner </i> stands as the image of a cyborg culture’s fear, love, and confusion.</p>
    <p>One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes.  Perhaps  paraplegics  and  other  severely  handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences  of  complex  hybridization  with  other  communications devices.<sup>35</sup> Anne  McCaffrey’s  prefeminist   <i class="italic">The  Ship  Who  Sang</i> (1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl’s brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely  handicapped  child.  Gender,  sexuality,  embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century till now, machines could be animated—given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacities. Or organisms could be mechanized—reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other  practice,  machines  can  be  prosthetic  devices,  intimate components, friendly selves. We don’t need organic holism to give impermeable wholeness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.</p>
    <p>The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic  the  statuses  of  man  or  woman,  human,  artifact, member of a race, individual entity, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of  <i class="italic">The Adventures of Alyx </i> or  <i class="italic">The Female Man, </i> where characters refuse the reader’s search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics.  <i class="italic">The Female Man </i> is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, especially  <i class="italic">Tales of Nevèrÿon, </i> mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the  founding  moves  of  Western  civilization  to  subvert  their plausibility. James Tiptree Jr., an author whose fiction was regarded  as  particularly  manly  until  her  “true”  gender  was  revealed,  tells  tales  of  reproduction  based  on  nonmammalian technologies  like  alternation  of  generations  of  male  brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old  woman-technological-device  on  whose surface  an  extraordinary  array  of  post-cyborg  symbioses  are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival <i class="italic">(Wild Seed)</i>, of time warps that bring a modern U.S.</p>
    <p>black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white  master–ancestor  determine  the  possibility  of  her  own birth <i class="italic">(Kindred)</i>, and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community  of  an  adopted  cross-species  child  who  came  to know the enemy as self <i class="italic">(Survivor)</i>. In  <i class="italic">Dawn </i>(1987), the first installment of a series called  <i class="italic">Xenogenesis, </i> Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam’s first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the United States. A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extraterrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who re-form Earth’s habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguistic, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late-twentieth-century race and gender.</p>
    <p>Because  it  is  particularly  rich  in  boundary  transgressions, Vonda McIntyre’s  <i class="italic">Superluminal </i> can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is “simply” human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Laenea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding  that  of  light.  Radu  Dracul  survives  a  virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and intimacy even in this world of protean transformation  and  connection.  <i class="italic">Superluminal  </i> stands  also  for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it  embodies  textually  the  intersection  of  feminist  theory  and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this essay. This is a conjunction with a long history that many “First World”  feminists  have  tried  to  repress,  including  myself  in my readings of  <i class="italic">Superluminal </i> before being called to account by Zoë Sofoulis (n.d.), whose different location in the world system’s informatics of domination made her acutely alert to the imperialist  moment  of  all  science  fiction  cultures,  including women’s science fiction. From an Australian feminist sensitiv-ity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre’s role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV’s  <i class="italic">Star Trek</i> series than her rewriting the romance in  <i class="italic">Superluminal. </i></p>
    <p>Monsters  have  always  defined  the  limits  of  community  in Western imaginations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centered polis of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases all crucial to establishing modern identity.<sup>36</sup> In the evolutionary  and  behavioral  sciences,  monkeys  and  apes  have  marked the multiple boundaries of late-twentieth- century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those pro-posed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.</p>
    <p>There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antag-onistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an  <i class="italic">it </i> to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines;  <i class="italic">they </i> do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric  extensions.  Only  by  being  out  of  place  could  we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be  global  identity  after  all,  even  if  it  has  profound  historical breadth and depth.</p>
    <p>The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life and so have a privileged epistemological position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes  visible  unvalued  female  activity  and  names  it  as  the ground of life.</p>
    <p>But   <i class="italic">the  </i> ground  of  life?  What  about  all  the  ignorance  of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men’s access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments?  Cyborg  gender  is  a  local  possibility  taking  a global  vengeance.  Race,  gender,  and  capital  require  a  cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system  waiting  to  become  a  political  language  to  ground  one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination—in order to act potently.</p>
    <p>One last image: organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.</p>
    <p>Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science  metaphysics,  a  demonology  of  technology,  and  so means embracing the skillful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear  into  the  circuits  of  the  super savers  of  the  new  right.  It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.</p>

    <p>5. A provocative, comprehensive argument about the politics and theories of “postmodernism” is made by Fredric Jameson (1984), who argues that postmodernism is not an option, a style among others, but a cultural dominant requiring radical reinvention of left politics from within; there is no longer any place from without that gives meaning to the comforting fiction of critical distance. Jameson also makes clear why one cannot be for or against postmodernism, an essentially moralist move. My position is that feminists (and others) need continuous cultural reinvention, most modernist critique, and historical materialism; only a cyborg would have a chance. The old dominations of white capitalist patriarchy seem nostalgically  innocent  now:  they  normalized  heterogeneity,  into  man  and woman, white and black, for example. “Advanced Capitalism” and postmodernism release heterogeneity without a norm, and we are flattened, without subjectivity, which requires depth, even unfriendly and drown-ing depths. It is time to write  <i class="italic">The Death of the Clinic. </i> The clinic’s methods required bodies and works; we have texts and surfaces. Our dominations don’t work by medicalization and normalization anymore; they work by networking, communications redesign, stress management. Normalization gives way to automation, utter redundancy. Michel Foucault’s  <i class="italic">Birth of</i> <i class="italic">the Clinic </i>(1963),  <i class="italic">History of Sexuality </i>(1976), and  <i class="italic">Discipline and Punish</i> (1975) name a form of power at its moment of implosion. The discourse of biopolitics gives way to technobabble, the language of the spliced substantive;  no  noun  is  left  whole  by  the  multinationals.

If we are imprisoned  by  language,  then  escape  from  that  prison-house  requires language poets, a kind of cultural restriction enzyme to cut the code; cyborg heteroglossia is one form of radical cultural politics.

Without  explicit  irony,  adopting  the  spaceship earth/whole earth logo of the planet photographed from space, set off by the slogan “Love Your Mother,” the May 1987 Mothers and Others Day action at the nuclear weapons testing facility in Nevada nonetheless took account of the tragic contradictions of views of the earth. Demonstrators applied for official permits to be on the land from officers of the Western Shoshone  tribe,  whose  territory  was  invaded  by  the  U.S.  government when it built the nuclear weapons test ground in the 1950s. Arrested for trespassing, the demonstrators argued that the police and weapons facility personnel, without authorization from the proper officials, were the trespassers. One affinity group at the women’s action called themselves the Surrogate Others; and in solidarity with the creatures forced to tunnel in the same ground with the bomb, they enacted a cyborgian emergence from the constructed body of a large, nonheterosexual desert worm. I was a member of that affinity group.</p>
